BSC THESIS
=========

The aim of the project was to create a fully customizable system that is designed to showcase the technologies and processes involved in developing applications using the OpenGL software interface. The project consists of two functions: a demonstrative one that presents the created application and a practical one that provides tools for editing various aspects of the application. The thesis includes a comprehensive presentation of information related to essential topics in computer graphics and rendering. The goal is to familiarize the reader with terms and concepts used in the development of such software.
